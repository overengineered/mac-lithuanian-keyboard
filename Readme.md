# Installing

* Execute in terminal

      git clone https://github.com/overengineered/mac-lithuanian-keyboard.git

      mkdir ~/Library/"Keyboard Layouts"

      cp -R mac-lithuanian-keyboard/ConvenientLithuanian.bundle ~/Library/"Keyboard Layouts"

* Go to Keyboard Preferences in System Preferences, choose Input Sources tab,
  click `+` near the bottom, locate others, choose Convenient Lithuanian.

  * If you see 2 items named "Convenient Lithuanian", you've encountered MacOS
    bug. Only one them will work properly, the other one you will not be able
    to select as active input source. You can discover which one is right by
    trial and error, or by clearing system caches (restarting in safe mode,
    or using some app, e.g Onyx, Yasu, Cocktail.)
